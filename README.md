### An easy way to find fun things near your!

##### This project was created at HackMerced24 to fix the problem of having nothing to do in Merced as a college student. It was built using the react native framework, Expo, alongside a firebase backend. Unfortunately this project is depreciated as the firebase backend has expired and no further development has been done to the project. This project was one of my first CRUD apps and taught me the basic http methods.
